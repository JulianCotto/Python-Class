At the following link https://github.com/JulianCotto/COSC-1336
You will find a recreation of a college level "Intro To Python" course.
This workbook is the repository that is used for doing book examples and homeworks. 
Clone this repository to VS Code per instructions found in COSC-1336/01 Introduction to Python/Lectures/. There are 2 videos there that cover Github and VSCode.

To use this workbook reference all knowledge provided at the above link.
Inside of Chapter folders you will find an assignment folder, a lectures folder, a readings folder, and an objective file. 
Start with the objectives file to get a feel for what you will be learning in that chapter. 
Read through the chapters folder next and use this repository's "src"-> "examples" pages, to recreate book examples; starting with chapter 2
**Note that the first chapter will not have any work to do as you familiarize yourself with the practice of coding**
Watch the lectures folder next to get a feel for application of the content you just read over. There is a file included that shows you the order in which to watch courses. A youtube link to the course playlist is also available if a video is "unwatchable". Use the "src"-> "examples" folder to recreate lectures examples
Go to the assignments folder next to get a homework that will require you to apply everything you have just learned. 
Fill out homework in the "src"->"homeworks" file. Write Test cases for homework in "tests"->"homework". Run test cases from the run_tests.py file on the main page. 
**Note that this repository will require you to use proper import statements to move relevant data between folders and perform proper testing** -> This process is covered in COSC-1336/01 Introduction to Python/Lectures/. There are 3 videos there that cover "Dev Process, Variables, Input, Unit Tests", "Python Overview, Tool, Unit Testing" & "Python Dev Process, Unit Tests, Variables, Input, Output"

I hope you take as much from this course as I did!!
